In supervised learning, a model is trained using labeled data, where it learns from a dataset that pairs inputs with the correct outputs, effectively guided by a teacher. This makes it easier for the model to understand and predict outcomes based on clear instructions. In contrast, RL is centered around an agent that learns through interaction with its environment. Instead of receiving explicit labels, the agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, thus learning from the consequences. This method involves exploring different strategies, and the agent must navigate sequences of actions that may lead to cumulative rewards, often complicating the process of credit assignment for its actions.
