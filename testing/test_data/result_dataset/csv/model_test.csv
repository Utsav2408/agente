A non-numerical rubric can still include feedback by: 1) Identifying key components of your rubric—specific criteria and categories for evaluation; 2) Describing evaluation methods that explain how you will assess the work; 3) Including feedback suggestions that guide students on improvement; and 4) Emphasizing that the purpose of feedback is to facilitate learning rather than assign grades. For example, criteria might include comprehension of material, production quality, and organization, while evaluation methods could involve observing participation or reviewing clarity in submissions. This approach encourages students to focus on learning and self-improvement rather than just grades."

"The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is calculated by summing the products of the units of each course and the grade points corresponding to the letter grades earned, then dividing this sum by the total number of units for the courses taken.",How is the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) calculated for students?,"The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is calculated by following these steps: 

1. **Obtain Grades**: Collect the letter grades and corresponding numerical values for each course.
2. **Grade Points**: Each course has specific grade points assigned based on the letter grades. 
3. **Total Grade Points**: Add up all grade points for the courses taken.
4. **Count Courses**: Determine the total number of courses completed.
5. **Average Grade Point per Course (GPPC)**: Divide the total grade points by the number of courses to get GPPC.
6. **Compute CGPA**: Multiply the GPPC by the total number of courses taken. 

Example:
If a student takes 10 courses with grades resulting in total grade points of 10, their GPPC would be 10/10 = 1, leading to a CGPA of 1 x 10 = 10.

It's important to note that methods may slightly vary among institutions, so verify the specific formula used in your school. Factors like credit units and weightage may also affect the calculation, resulting in an overall CGPA expressed as a decimal (e.g., 3.50)."
"CGPA is used to describe the overall academic performance of a student on a 10 point scale, encompassing all courses for which letter grades are awarded, and it excludes non-letter grades from the calculation.",What is the significance of CGPA in evaluating a student's academic performance?,"The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is significant in evaluating a student's academic performance for several reasons. Firstly, it serves as a comprehensive measure of a student's achievements across all courses, factoring in the total credit units, the number of courses taken, and the grades received. Secondly, the CGPA provides a weighted average, where courses with more credit units have a greater influence on the overall score. This not only offers a holistic view of performance but also facilitates standardized comparisons across different academic institutions or programs. Additionally, CGPA affects important academic outcomes such as eligibility for academic probation and access to future educational opportunities, as many institutions set minimum CGPA requirements for students to continue their studies. By indicating where a student stands within a structured grading framework, CGPA highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in a student's educational journey."

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect:

1. **Positive impacts**: Engaging with new employers or mentors can offer you fresh learning opportunities, enhance your skills, and provide industry-specific knowledge that can enrich your experience in WILP.

These programs are managed by BITS Pilani’s Academic Operations Committee, and the tracking of student enrollments is conducted through various systems. It's always best to verify this with your academic advisor or program manager.

4. **Process for notifying changes**: If you do change your employer or mentor, it is essential to inform the program administrators. You can do this by contacting them directly through email or phone.
